## Usage

First you must install the dependencies via NPM using:

```
npm install
```

To build the addon, run the following command:

```
npx c3fo build
```

To start the dev server, run:

```
npx c3fo build -D
```

The build uses the `addon.ts` file for the configurations and the `runtime.ts` file as the entry point to generate everything else.
The files defined with `@AceClass` contain all the Actions, Conditions and Expressions logic and configuration, you may want to check them.
