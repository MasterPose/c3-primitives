# Construct 3 Primitive Plugins

A bundle of missing primitive objects for Construct 3.

*From (not) the creators of the global plugin, comes, more empty plugins with a bit more functionality...*

## Brief

### Vector

A wold object as a Vector 2D. 

With all the useful Vector 2D transformations as actions & expressions.

> [!TIP]
> You could set a Vector object as a global object, to always have a way to quickly calculate stuff.

### Collider 

A graphicless wold object only visible on editor. 

Meant to detect collisions, overlaping or to use as a transparent wall with Solid behavior.

Zero GPU consumption, but most importantly, zero graphics to be packaged on export.
